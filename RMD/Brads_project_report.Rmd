# `r STREAM_NAME` Creek Streamflow and Temperature Statistical Analysis
</center>

This report was created by the Palouse Conservation District (PCD) and contains a statistical analysis to determine the presence of significant differences in summer streamflow and water temperature values pre and post 2011 in `r STREAM_NAME` Creek. For more information, please contact Ryan Boylan at RyanB@PalouseCD.org or Gerrit Bass at GerritB@PalouseCD.org. For more information about the program, visit PCD's Research and Monitoring website, https://www.palousecd.org/research-and-monitoring.

# Streamflow Analysis

## Monthly Average Summer Streamflows

This graph displays the average monthly streamflow for the summer months both before and after 2011.

``` {r Q_graph, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

# create graph of monthly average flow before and after 2011
Q_graph <- SUMMER_Q %>% 
  mutate(Month = factor(month.abb[Month], levels = month.abb)) %>% # change numeric values for months to abbreviated Month names for display on graph 
  group_by(Month, Group) %>% #group data based on month and before/after 2011
  summarize(avg_monthly_flow = mean(Value)) %>% #take the average of each group
  ggplot(aes(x = Month, y = avg_monthly_flow, color = Group, group = Group))+
  geom_point(size = 3, stat='summary', fun.y = sum)+ #stat and fun.y are to set up stat summary so points can be connected despite being discrete data
  stat_summary(fun.y = sum, geom = "line", size = 1)+ # use instead of geom_line since data is discrete
  scale_color_manual(values=c("#E69F00", "#56B4E9"))+
  labs(y = 'Average Monthly Streamflow (cfs)')+
  theme_minimal()

Q_graph

```

## Histogram of Streamflow

Graphing a histogram is a good way to start visualizing the distribution of a data set. It gives us an idea of if the data has a normal distribution and helps us visualize any differences in data pre and post 2011. 

```{r Q_histogram, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=TRUE}
Q_hist<-ggplot(SUMMER_Q, aes(x= Value, color= Group)) +
  geom_histogram(fill="white", position="dodge")+ # position helps to display spots where before and after 2011 overlap
  scale_color_manual(values=c("#E69F00", "#56B4E9"))+
  theme(legend.position="top")+
  labs(x = "Streamflow (cfs)")
Q_hist

```

\newpage

## Q-Q Plot

A Q-Q plot, or quantile-quantile plot, is another way to visualize the distribution of a data set. The deviation of streamflow from the line displayed in the figure below indicates a lack of normality in the data. Knowing this helps us decide which statistical tests are relevant for the data. 

```{r Q_qqplots, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=TRUE}
ggqqplot(SUMMER_Q, x = "Value",
         ggtheme = theme_pubclean())+
  labs(title = "Streamflow (cfs)")

```

## Shapiro Test of Streamflow

The Shapiro Test is a test of normality to aid in deciding what statistical test should be used. P-values greater than 0.05 represent normal data distribution, while values less than 0.05 assume a non-normal distribution.

``` {r Q_shapiro_test, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
shapiro_Q <- shapiro_test(SUMMER_Q$Value) %>% # preform shapiro test
  select(-1) %>%  #remove unneeded columns from table
  rename('p-value' = 'p.value') %>% 
  add_column( "Is Data Normal?" = if_else(.$`p-value` > 0.05, "YES", "NO")) %>% # add a column that states normality based on p-value
  flextable() %>% #make a pretty table
  set_formatter(`p-value` = function(x) {
    formatC(x, format = "e", digits = 3)
  }) %>% # force p-value into scientific notation
  set_formatter( statistic = function(x){
    formatC(x, digits = 3) # limit values to 3 decimal points
  }) %>% 
  width(width = 1) %>% # set column width
  align(j = 3, align ='center', part = 'all') # center the last column

shapiro_Q

```

## Streamflow Statistical Analysis

Below are the statistical parameters for summer streamflow in `r STREAM_NAME` Creek before and after 2011. Count is the the number of observations in each group. Variance and standard deviation (sd) are both measures of how spread out the data is. The mean of a dataset is found by adding up all values and dividing by the toal number of values, while the median is the middle number in a dataset, when the data is ordered from smallest to largest. If a dataset is non-normal, the mean, also known as the average, is a better value to use than the median. Inerquartile Range (IQR) is the distance from 25 percentile of the data to the 75th percentile of the data and is a measure of where the majority of the data lies from the mean. A smaller IQR means more tighly grouped data and visa versa.

```{r Q_stats, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# Stats summary
group_by(SUMMER_Q, Group) %>%
  summarise(count = n(),
            variance = var(Value, na.rm = TRUE),
            mean = mean(Value, na.rm=TRUE),
            sd = sd(Value, na.rm=TRUE),
            median = median(Value, na.rm=TRUE),
            IQR = IQR(Value, na.rm=TRUE)
  ) %>% 
  flextable() %>% 
  colformat_double(digits = 2) %>% # rounds values to 2 decimal points
  autofit()
```

## Streamflow Boxplots

Boxplots allow us to visualize the data displayed in the table above. The thick line in the middle of the box is the Median value and the lines that form the outside of the box are the 25th and 75th percentile of the data. The "whiskers" or lines coming out of the boxes extend to the minimum and maximum values and the dots represent any values classified as outliers. 

``` {r Q_boxplot, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}

box_Q <- ggplot(SUMMER_Q, aes(x = Group, y = Value, fill = Group ))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("#E69F00", "#56B4E9"))+
  theme_classic()+
  labs(x = '',y = 'Streamflow (cfs)')+
  theme(legend.position="none")

``` {r kruskal_for_Q, echo=F, message=F, warning=F}
kruskal_q <- kruskal_test(Value ~ Group, data = SUMMER_Q) %>%
  select(-1,-6) %>% #remove unneeded columns 
  rename('p-value' = 'p') %>% 
  add_column( "Is there a Statistical Difference?" = if_else(.$`p-value` < 0.05, "YES", "NO"))# add a column that states stat difference based on p-value


# save a variable to print in rmd file based on answer to stat diff question  
kruskal_q_statement <- ifelse(kruskal_q$`Is there a Statistical Difference?` == "YES","This analaysis indicates there is a statistically significant difference between pre and post-2011 data.",
                                 "This analaysis indicates there is not a statistically significant difference between pre and post-2011 data.")
```

## Kruskal-Wallis Test

The Kruskal-Wallis test is used to check for statistical differences between pre and post-2011 streamflow. It assumes a non-normal distribution and a p-value less than 0.05, in this test, represents a statistical difference between sample groups. The statistic value in the table below is the Kruskal-Wallis rank sum statistic that is used to compute the p-value.

**`r kruskal_q_statement`** 

``` {r kruskal_for_Q_table, echo=F, message=F, warning=F}

#plot as fextable
kruskal_q %>% 
flextable() %>% #make pretty table
set_formatter(`p-value` = function(x) {
  formatC(x, format = "e", digits = 3)
}) %>% # force pvalue to sci notation
set_formatter( statistic = function(x){
  formatC(x, digits = 3)}) %>% # limit table to 3 decimal points

# Water Temperature Analysis

## Monthly Average Water Temperature

This graph displays the average monthly water temperature for pre and post-2011 temperature data.

  group_by(Month, Group) %>% 
  summarize(avg_monthly_temp = mean(Value)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Month, y = avg_monthly_temp, group = Group, color = Group))+
  geom_point(size = 3, stat='summary', fun.y = sum)+
  stat_summary(fun.y = sum, geom = "line", size = 1)+

## Shapiro Test For Stream Temperature

The Shapiro Test is a test of normality to aid in deciding what statistical test should be used.A p-value greater than 0.05 represents a normal data distribution, while values less than 0.05 assume a non-normal distribution.
